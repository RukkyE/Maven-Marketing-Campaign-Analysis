# Maven-Marketing-Campaign-Analysis
A repository for the analysis of the records of customers for the Maven Marketing Campaign using Microsoft Excel
The datasets used for this project are included in the repository. <br />

## Introduction
In this project, I analysed the records of 2,240 customers for the Maven Marketing Campaign based on the customers' profiles, product preferences, campaign successes or failures and channel performance. <br />
The aim of the project is to analyse;
* The factors significantly related to the number of web purchases. <br />
* The most successful marketing campaign. <br />
* What the average customer looks like. <br />
* The best performing products. <br />
* The channels that are underperforming. <br />

## Data Exploration
The dataset of this project contains 1 CSV file which I imported into Microsoft Excel Query Editor. I checked for duplicate records but discovered there was none because each row in the dataset represents the record for each customer. The following are some of the key insights I generated;
* Total Revenue Generated = $2,028,591
* Total Quantity Sold = 9,119
* Total Order Made = 2,000
* Total Order Purchased = 1,823
* Average Price Per Item = $223.67
* Total Number of Sales Person = 8
